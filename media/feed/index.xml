<p>Right now, for example, that involves being named in a lawsuit over the future of health care reform before the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>But Burwell can escape the anti-Obamacare vibes for a bit on her upcoming visit to health reform-friendly Massachusetts.</p>
<p>She is among an elite group of health and science leaders who will speak next month at the <b class="b">W</b><b class="b">orld Medical Innovation Forum</b>, a new event sponsored by <b class="b">Partners HealthCare.</b></p>
<p>Partners, the system that includes<b class="b"> Massachusetts General</b> and <b class="b">Brigham and Women’s</b> hospitals, developed a program featuring a list of headliners who are at the forefront of research and innovation. The list of speakers includes high-profile local chief executives: <b class="b">Jeffrey Leiden</b> of Boston’s <b class="b">Vertex Pharmaceuticals</b>, <b class="b">Michael Mahoney</b> of Marlborough-based <b class="b">Boston Scientific</b>,<b class="b"> Deborah Dunsire</b> of Watertown-based <b class="b">Forum Pharmaceuticals</b>, and from Cambridge, <b class="b">David Meeker</b> of <b class="b">Genzyme,</b> and <b class="b">George Scangos</b> of <b class="b">Biogen Idec.</b></p>
<p>Also on the schedule is <b class="b">Ann Romney</b>, who is the wife of the former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate, and an ambassador for multiple sclerosis patients.</p>
<p>Brigham last year named its <b class="b">Center for Neurologic Diseases</b> for Romney, who was diagnosed with MS in 1998.</p>
<p>The innovation forum, slated for April 27 to 29 at the <b class="b">Westin Copley Place</b> hotel, will be centered on neuroscience.</p>
<p>Of course, being sponsored by the state’s biggest health system, the event will include plenty of speakers with Partners on their name tags.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BELMONT — Ann Romney knows a lot about political campaigns. Win or lose, there’s one thing you gain for sure: a network of people with an awful lot of money.</p>
<p>They couldn’t put her husband, Mitt, in the White House, but she’s now hoping everyone will get behind her to launch the <a class="a" href="http://www.bwhannromneycenter.org/">Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases</a> at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Her goal is to create a new model for research and funding, setting out to raise $50 million over the next year to help find treatments and cures for five conditions: multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Lou Gehrig’s (ALS), Parkinson’s, and brain tumors.</p>
<p>The Romneys are seeding the center with what Ann calls a “substantial gift.” And I trust that it is big. Before Mitt’s two failed presidential bids and before he served as our governor, he made a fortune as founder of Bain Capital, the Boston buyout firm.</p>
<p>This is hardly a vanity project for Mrs. Romney. She has lived for 16 years with MS, a chronic disease of the immune system in which nerves deteriorate, causing symptoms as severe as paralysis. Her doctor, Howard Weiner, is at the Brigham and the idea for a new center came two years ago following a routine visit. Romney’s MS, initially treated with steroids, has been in remission for more than a decade and is now managed by a healthy diet and exercise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="435">For the first time, and to the astonishment of many of their colleagues, researchers created what they call <a class="meta-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Alzheimer's Disease." href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/alzheimers-disease/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Alzheimer’s</a> in a Dish — a petri dish with human brain cells that develop the telltale structures of Alzheimer’s disease. In doing so, they resolved a longstanding problem of how to study Alzheimer’s and search for drugs to treat it; the best they had until now were mice that developed an imperfect form of the disease.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="479" data-total-count="914">The key to their success, said the lead researcher, Rudolph E. Tanzi of <a title="More articles about Massachusetts General Hospital" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/massachusetts_general_hospital/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> in Boston, was a suggestion by his colleague Doo Yeon Kim to grow human brain cells in a gel, where they formed networks as in an actual brain. They gave the neurons genes for Alzheimer’s disease. Within weeks they saw the hard Brillo-like clumps known as plaques and then the twisted spaghetti-like coils known as tangles — the defining features of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
